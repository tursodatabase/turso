## Introduction

Limbo is an in-process relational database engine, aiming towards full compatibility with SQLite.

Unlike client-server database systems such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, which require applications to communicate over network protocols for SQL execution,
an in-process database is in your application memory space.
This embedded architecture eliminates network communication overhead, allowing for the best case of low read and write latencies in the order of sub-microseconds.

### Getting Started

You can install Limbo on your computer as follows:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/limbo-installer.sh | sh
```

When you have the software installed, you can start a SQL shell as follows:

```console
$ limbo
Limbo
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database
limbo> SELECT 'hello, world';
hello, world
```

## Limitations

Limbo aims towards full SQLite compatibility but has the following limitations:

* No multi-process access
* No multi-threading
* No indexing
* No savepoints
* No triggers
* No views
* No vacuum

For more detailed list of SQLite compatibility, please refer to [COMPAT.md](../COMPAT.md).

## The SQL language

## SQLite C API

Limbo supports the SQLite C API, with libSQL extensions.

### WAL manipulation

#### `libsql_wal_frame_count`

Get the number of frames in the WAL.

**Synopsis:**

```c
int libsql_wal_frame_count(sqlite3 *db, uint32_t *p_frame_count);
```

**Description:**

The `libsql_wal_frame_count` function returns the number of frames in the WAL
in the `p_frame_count` parameter.

**Return Values:**

* `SQLITE_OK` if the number of frames in the WAL file is successfully returned.
* `SQLITE_MISUSE` if the `db` is NULL.
* SQLITE_ERROR if an error occurs while getting the number of frames in the WAL
  file.

**Safety Requirements:**

* The `db` parameter must be a valid pointer to a `sqlite3` database
  connection.
* The `p_frame_count` must be a valid pointer to a `u32` that will store the
* number of frames in the WAL file.

## SQL Commands

## Appendix A: Limbo Internals

Limbo's architecture resembles SQLite's but differs primarily in its
asynchronous I/O model. This asynchronous design enables applications to
leverage modern I/O interfaces like `io_uring,` maximizing storage device
performance. While an in-process database offers significant performance
advantages, integration with cloud services remains crucial for operations
like backups. Limbo's asynchronous I/O model facilitates this by supporting
networked storage capabilities.

The high-level interface to Limbo is the same as in SQLite:

* SQLite query language
* The `sqlite3_prepare()` function for translating SQL statements to programs
  ("prepared statements")
* The `sqlite3_step()` function for executing programs

If we start with the SQLite query language, you can use the `limbo`
command, for example, to evaluate SQL statements in the shell:

```
limbo> SELECT 'hello, world';
hello, world
```

To execute this SQL statement, the shell uses the `sqlite3_prepare()`
interface to parse the statement and generate a bytecode program, a step
called preparing a statement. When a statement is prepared, it can be executed
using the `sqlite3_step()` function.

To illustrate the different components of Limbo, we can look at the sequence
diagram of a query from the CLI to the bytecode virtual machine (VDBE):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant main as cli/main
participant Database as core/lib/Database
participant Connection as core/lib/Connection
participant Parser as sql/mod/Parser
participant translate as translate/mod
participant Statement as core/lib/Statement
participant Program as vdbe/mod/Program

main->>Database: open_file
Database->>main: Connection
main->>Connection: query(sql)
Note left of Parser: Parser uses vendored sqlite3-parser
Connection->>Parser: next()
Note left of Parser: Passes the SQL query to Parser

Parser->>Connection: Cmd::Stmt (ast/mod.rs)

Note right of translate: Translates SQL statement into bytecode
Connection->>translate:translate(stmt)

translate->>Connection: Program 

Connection->>main: Ok(Some(Rows { Statement }))

note right of main: a Statement with <br />a reference to Program is returned

main->>Statement: step()
Statement->>Program: step()
Note left of Program: Program executes bytecode instructions<br />See https://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html
Program->>Statement: StepResult
Statement->>main: StepResult
```

To drill down into more specifics, we inspect the bytecode program for a SQL
statement using the `EXPLAIN` command in the shell. For our example SQL
statement, the bytecode looks as follows:

```
limbo> EXPLAIN SELECT 'hello, world';
addr  opcode             p1    p2    p3    p4             p5  comment
----  -----------------  ----  ----  ----  -------------  --  -------
0     Init               0     4     0                    0   Start at 4
1     String8            0     1     0     hello, world   0   r[1]='hello, world'
2     ResultRow          1     1     0                    0   output=r[1]
3     Halt               0     0     0                    0
4     Transaction        0     0     0                    0
5     Goto               0     1     0                    0
```

The instruction set of the virtual machine consists of domain specific
instructions for a database system. Every instruction consists of an
opcode that describes the operation and up to 5 operands. In the example
above, execution starts at offset zero with the `Init` instruction. The
instruction sets up the program and branches to a instruction at address
specified in operand `p2`. In our example, address 4 has the
`Transaction` instruction, which begins a transaction. After that, the
`Goto` instruction then branches to address 1 where we load a string
constant `'hello, world'` to register `r[1]`. The `ResultRow` instruction
produces a SQL query result using contents of `r[1]`. Finally, the
program terminates with the `Halt` instruction.

### Frontend

#### Parser

The parser is the module in the front end that processes SQLite query language input data, transforming it into an abstract syntax tree (AST) for further processing. The parser is an in-tree fork of [lemon-rs](https://github.com/gwenn/lemon-rs), which in turn is a port of SQLite parser into Rust. The emitted AST is handed over to the code generation steps to turn the AST into virtual machine programs.

#### Code generator

The code generator module takes AST as input and produces virtual machine programs representing executable SQL statements. At high-level, code generation works as follows:

1. `JOIN` clauses are transformed into equivalent `WHERE` clauses, which simplifies code generation.
2. `WHERE` clauses are mapped into bytecode loops
3. `ORDER BY` causes the bytecode program to pass result rows to a sorter before returned to the application.
4. `GROUP BY` also causes the bytecode programs to pass result rows to an aggregation function before results are returned to the application.
  
#### Query optimizer

### Virtual Machine

### MVCC

The database implements a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) using a hybrid architecture that combines an in-memory index with persistent storage through WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) and SQLite database files. The implementation draws from the Hekaton approach documented in Larson et al. (2011), with key modifications for durability handling.

The database maintains a centralized in-memory MVCC index that serves as the primary coordination point for all database connections. This index provides shared access across all active connections and stores the most recent versions of modified data. It implements version visibility rules for concurrent transactions following the Hekaton MVCC design. The architecture employs a three-tier storage hierarchy consisting of the MVCC index in memory as the primary read/write target for active transactions, a page cache in memory serving as an intermediate buffer for data retrieved from persistent storage, and persistent storage comprising WAL files and SQLite database files on disk.

_Read operations_ follow a lazy loading strategy with a specific precedence order. The database first queries the in-memory MVCC index to check if the requested row exists and is visible to the current transaction. If the row is not found in the MVCC index, the system performs a lazy read from the page cache. When necessary, the page cache retrieves data from both the WAL and the underlying SQLite database file.

_Write operations_ are handled entirely within the in-memory MVCC index during transaction execution. This design provides high-performance writes with minimal latency, immediate visibility of changes within the transaction scope, and isolation from other concurrent transactions until the transaction is committed.

_Commit operation_ ensures durability through a two-phase approach: first, the system writes the complete transaction write set from the MVCC index to the page cache, then the page cache contents are flushed to the WAL, ensuring durable storage of the committed transaction. This commit protocol guarantees that once a transaction commits successfully, all changes are persisted to durable storage and will survive system failures.

While the implementation follows Hekaton's core MVCC principles, it differs in one significant aspect regarding logical change tracking. Unlike Hekaton, this system does not maintain a record of logical changes after flushing data to the WAL. This design choice simplifies compatibility with the SQLite database file format.
