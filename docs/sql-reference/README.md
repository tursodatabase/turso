# SQL Language Reference

This directory contains the Turso SQL language reference documentation. The files are `.mdx` (Markdown + JSX components) and render as readable markdown on GitHub.

## Structure

## Editing guidelines

- Turso-specific features are marked with `<Info>` callouts. Keep this convention.
- Experimental features should link to `experimental-features.mdx` for enablement instructions.
- Unsupported SQLite features are documented only in `compatibility.mdx`, not on individual pages.
- Every function should have a parameter table with types, a return type, and at least one example.
- Use `sql` language tags on all code blocks.
- Keep pages self-contained — use explicit cross-references instead of "as mentioned above".

## Local preview (optional)

These docs are integrated into [turso-docs](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-docs) for production rendering with Mintlify. To preview locally, use mdBook (OSS, no Node required):

```bash
# Install mdbook if you don't have it
cargo install mdbook

# Preview with live reload at http://localhost:3000
cd docs/sql-reference
./preview.sh
```

The script converts `.mdx` files to markdown, transforms Mintlify callouts to blockquotes, and serves via mdBook. The `<Info>`/`<Warning>` callouts render as blockquotes — not as styled boxes, but all content is readable.

If you add a new page, update `preview.sh` to include it in the SUMMARY.
