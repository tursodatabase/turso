# SQLite Compatibility

The authoritative compatibility reference is maintained at [`COMPAT.md`](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/blob/main/COMPAT.md) in the repository root. It tracks the support status for every SQL statement, expression, function, PRAGMA, C API function, VDBE opcode, and extension.

Refer to that document for the current state of compatibility. It is updated alongside code changes to stay accurate.

## Turso-Specific Extensions

These features extend Turso beyond SQLite compatibility:

| Feature | Description |

| [BEGIN CONCURRENT](/docs/sql-reference/statements/transactions#begin-concurrent) | Optimistic concurrent write transactions (MVCC) |
| [Vector functions](/docs/sql-reference/functions/vector) | Vector storage, distance calculations, similarity search |
| [Full-text search](/docs/sql-reference/functions/fts) | Tantivy-powered FTS with BM25 scoring |
