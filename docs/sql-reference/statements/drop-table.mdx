# DROP TABLE

Remove a table and all its data, indexes, triggers, and constraints from the database.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] [schema-name.]table-name;
```

## Description

`DROP TABLE` permanently removes a table definition and all data stored in the table. All indexes, triggers, and constraints associated with the table are also removed.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `IF EXISTS` | Prevents an error if the table does not exist. The statement is a no-op when the table is absent. |
| `schema-name` | The name of the attached database containing the table. Defaults to the main database if omitted. |
| `table-name` | The name of the table to drop. |

### Behavior

- All rows in the table are deleted.
- All indexes built on the table are removed.
- All triggers associated with the table are removed.
- The table entry is removed from the `sqlite_schema` system table.
- If foreign key constraints reference the dropped table, those references become invalid. Turso does not prevent dropping a table that is referenced by foreign keys in other tables.
- `DROP TABLE` is not allowed while the table is being read or written by another statement in the same connection.

## Examples

### Drop a Table

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

### Drop a Table Only if It Exists

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temporary_results;
```

### Drop a Table in an Attached Database

```sql
DROP TABLE aux.sessions;
```
