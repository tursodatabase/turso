# DROP VIEW

Remove a view definition from the database. The underlying tables and their data are not affected.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] [schema-name.]view-name;
```

## Description

`DROP VIEW` removes a previously created view. After the view is dropped, queries referencing the view name produce an error. The tables referenced by the view are unaffected.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `IF EXISTS` | Prevents an error if the view does not exist. The statement is a no-op when the view is absent. |
| `schema-name` | The name of the attached database containing the view. Defaults to the main database if omitted. |
| `view-name` | The name of the view to drop. |

### Behavior

- Any triggers defined as INSTEAD OF on the dropped view are also removed.
- If the view is a materialized view, the stored data is also removed.

## Examples

### Drop a View

```sql
DROP VIEW active_users;
```

### Drop a View Only if It Exists

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS old_report;
```

### Drop a View in an Attached Database

```sql
DROP VIEW aux.cached_stats;
```
