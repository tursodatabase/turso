# DETACH DATABASE

The DETACH DATABASE statement removes a previously attached database from the current connection. After detaching, tables in that database are no longer accessible through the schema name.

## Syntax

```sql
DETACH [DATABASE] schema-name;
```

## Description

DETACH closes the connection to the attached database identified by `schema-name` and frees its resources. Any subsequent references to `schema-name.table-name` will fail.

### Clauses

| Clause | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DATABASE` | Optional keyword. Has no effect on behavior. |
| `schema-name` | The schema name assigned when the database was attached. |

The `main` and `temp` schemas cannot be detached.

<Info>
DETACH cannot be used while a transaction is active. Commit or roll back any open transaction before detaching a database.
</Info>

## Examples

### Detach a Database

```sql
ATTACH 'archive.db' AS archive;

-- Use the attached database
SELECT count(*) FROM archive.events;

-- Detach when done
DETACH DATABASE archive;
```

### Detach Without the DATABASE Keyword

```sql
DETACH archive;
```
