# DROP TRIGGER

The DROP TRIGGER statement removes a trigger from the database schema. Once dropped, the trigger no longer fires in response to its associated table events.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [schema-name.]trigger-name;
```

## Description

DROP TRIGGER removes the named trigger from the database. The trigger must exist unless the `IF EXISTS` clause is specified.

### Clauses

| Clause | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IF EXISTS` | Suppresses the error that would occur if the trigger does not exist. The statement is a no-op when the trigger is not found. |
| `schema-name` | The name of the attached database containing the trigger. When omitted, Turso searches for the trigger in the main database. |
| `trigger-name` | The name of the trigger to remove. |

Dropping a trigger does not affect any data in the table the trigger was associated with. It only removes the trigger definition from the schema.

## Examples

### Drop a Trigger

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_insert AFTER INSERT ON users
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, user_id) VALUES ('insert', NEW.id);
END;

-- Remove the trigger
DROP TRIGGER log_insert;
```

### Drop a Trigger with IF EXISTS

```sql
-- Safe to run even if the trigger does not exist
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_insert;
```

### Drop a Trigger in an Attached Database

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS aux.log_insert;
```
