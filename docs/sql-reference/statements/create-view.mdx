# CREATE VIEW

Create a named view that encapsulates a SELECT statement.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE [TEMPORARY] VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] [schema-name.]view-name
    AS select-statement;
```

## Description

A view is a virtual table defined by a SELECT statement. It does not store data on disk -- every time you query the view, Turso executes the underlying SELECT. Views simplify complex queries, provide a stable interface over evolving table schemas, and restrict which columns or rows are visible.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `TEMPORARY` | Creates the view in a temporary database. The view is visible only to the current connection and is dropped when the connection closes. `TEMP` is accepted as a synonym. |
| `IF NOT EXISTS` | Prevents an error if a view with the same name already exists. The statement is a no-op when the view is present. |
| `schema-name` | The name of the attached database in which to create the view. Defaults to the main database if omitted. Cannot be used with `TEMPORARY`. |
| `view-name` | A unique name for the view within the database. |
| `select-statement` | The SELECT query that defines the view's contents. |

### Behavior

- Views are read-only. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on a view are not supported unless an INSTEAD OF trigger is defined on the view.
- The SELECT statement is stored in the `sqlite_schema` table and parsed each time the view is referenced.
- If a table referenced by the view is dropped or altered in an incompatible way, queries against the view produce an error.

## Examples

### Simplify a Common Query

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Use the view like a table
SELECT * FROM active_users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

### Aggregate View

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_stats AS
SELECT
    department,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

SELECT * FROM department_stats ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

### Temporary View for a Session

```sql
CREATE TEMP VIEW my_tasks AS
SELECT id, title, due_date
FROM tasks
WHERE assignee = 'alice';
```
