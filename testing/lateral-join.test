# Tests for LATERAL JOIN functionality
# Based on Master's thesis "Lateral Join for SQLite" by Jonatan Braun (2021)
#
# Note: LATERAL JOIN currently works with subqueries as the left-side table.
# Support for BTree tables as the left-side requires additional changes to
# the cursor emission order and is a future enhancement.
