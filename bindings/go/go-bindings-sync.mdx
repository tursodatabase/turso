<Code model="openai/gpt-5" language="go">

Generate Go functions bindings for the sync engine built on top of Turso - SQLite-compatible embedded database written in Rust.
You must use C API bridge implemented in Rust which expose ABI compatible functions to interact with the database.

The main goal is to translate C code to Go-friendly bindings which will have no additional logic, but more ergonomic API:
1. Return (err error) when possible
2. Manipulate with strings accordingly

# Bindings

You must generate bindings for C interface defined in turso_sync.h file.

<File path="../../sync/sdk-kit/turso_sync.h" />

Note, that this header file depends on the turso.h definitions for which Go bindings already exists.
You MUST just reuse them. DO NOT copy or reimplement these bindings:

<File path="../../sdk-kit/turso.h" />
<File path="./bindings_db.go" />

# Rules

General rules for driver implementation you **MUST** follow and never go against these rules:
- DO NOT USE cgo, USE purego instead
- DO NOT introduce any new public methods - export turso.h content as-is
- DO NOT register library - this will be done externally
- AVOID unnecessary FFI calls as their cost is non zero
- AVOID unnecessary strings transformations - replace them with more efficient alternatives if possible
- FOCUS on code readability: if possible extract helper function but make sure that it will be used more than once and that it really contribute to the code readability
- WATCH OUT for variables scopes and do not use variables which are no longer accessible
- WATCH OUT for string representations: in some cases library expected zero terminated C-string and in some cases library operates with string/byte slices
- BE AWARE, that purego marshal only explicit parameters of the function calls. If you have C struct passed by reference - you need to do marshalling by yourself (e.g. convert strings to zero-terminated C strings, etc)
- STRUCTURE of the implementation 
    * Declaration order of elements and semantic blocks MUST be exsactly the same
    * (details and full enumerations omited in the example for brevity but you must generate full code)
```go
package turso

// define all package level errors here

// define opaque pointers as-is and accept them as exact arguments (e.g. func turso_database_connect(self TursoDatabase) ... - DO NOT add extra indirection)
type TursoSyncDatabase *turso_sync_database_t

// define all public binding types
// the public binding types MUST have fields with native safe go types 
type TursoSyncDatabaseConfig struct { ... }

// define all necessary private C structs
// private C structs MUST have fields with low level types (e.g. uintptr, numbers)
type turso_sync_database_config_t struct { ... }

// then, define C extern methods
var (
    // always use c_ structs here - never mix them with exported public types
	c_turso_sync_database_new func(
		dbConfig *c_turso_database_config_t,
		syncConfig *c_turso_sync_database_config_t,
		database unsafe.Pointer,
		errorOptOut unsafe.Pointer,
	) c_turso_status_code_t
    ...
)

// imiplement a function to register extern methods from loaded lib
// DO NOT load lib - as it will be done externally
func register_turso_sync(handle uintptr) error {
    purego.RegisterLibFunc(&c_turso_sync_database_new, handle, "turso_sync_database_new")
    ...
}

// Go wrappers over imported C bindings
// always use exported public types here - never mix them with c_ structs
func turso_sync_database_new(...) ... { ... }
```


# Implementation

- The package name is "github.com/tursodatabase/turso/go"
- Use exactly same names as in turso_sync.h for Go method names and prepend `c_` prefix for C extern functions
- Separate "public" types from "private" types:
    * public types MUST be used ONLY in Go bindings methods (`turso_sync_.*`) and have fields with native safe go types (string, slice, etc)
    * public types MUST NOT use low level types explicitly (e.g. unintptr) - they must be either replaced with wrapper public type or native alternative must be used instead (e.g. int instead of uinptrt if this is size_t)
    * private types MUST be used ONLY in C wrapper functions (`c_turso_sync_.*`) and have fields with low-level C-compatible go types (uintptr, numbers, etc)
- Document generated methods with docstrings
- Replace `turso_status_code_t` and out error parameter with proper native golang `error`
- Convert C-strings back and forth appropriately
    * Remember, that Golang strings are not null-terminated - so you will need to convert them to zero-terminated strings by copying data in some cases


# Purego

Inspect following docstring from the official purego repository in order to understand how marshalling works:
