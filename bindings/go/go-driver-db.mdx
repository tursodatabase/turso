Generate Go SDK for the Turso - SQLite-compatible embedded database written in Rust.
You must use bindings_db.go bridge from Go to C API.

# Bindings

<File path="./bindings_db.go" />

# Implementation

The SDK should has following components under the hood:
* `type tursoDbConnection struct { }` - wrapper which holds connection to the turso and protect it against concurrent use
* `type tursoDbStatement struct { }` - wrapper which holds prepared statement to the turso and protect it against concurrent use
* `type tursoDbRows struct { }` - wrapper which holds prepared statement and provide sqld/database compatible methods to iterate over rows of the statement
* `type tursoDbDriver struct { }` - type to register in the sql/database as driver
* `type tursoDbResult struct { }` - type implementing `driver.Result` interface
* `type tursoDbTx struct { }` - type implementing `driver.Tx` interface

# Go driver API

Inspect go sql driver documentation and follow it during implementation:

<Shell cmd="go doc -all sql" />

</Code>
