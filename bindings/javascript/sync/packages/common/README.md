## About

This package is the Turso Sync common JS library which is shared between final builds for Node and Browser.

Do not use this package directly - instead you must use `@tursodatabase/sync` or `@tursodatabase/sync-wasm`.

> **⚠️ Warning:** This software is ALPHA, only use for development, testing, and experimentation. We are working to make it production ready, but do not use it for critical data right now.
