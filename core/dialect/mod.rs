//! SQL dialects.
//!
//! The [`Dialect`] trait is the boundary between the engine and the SQL
//! dialect a frontend speaks. The engine owns the mechanics — pages,
//! B-trees, the `sqlite_schema` table itself, bytecode — and consults the
//! dialect wherever the meaning of SQL text is dialect-specific: parsing
//! statements into the engine AST and interpreting persisted schema text.
//! The [`sqlite`] module owns [`SqliteDialect`], the SQLite
//! implementation, and the catalog tables that ship with every Turso
//! build (`pragma_*`, `json_each`/`json_tree`, `sqlite_dbpage`,
//! `btree_dump`, `sqlite_turso_types`).
