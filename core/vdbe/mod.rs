//! The virtual database engine (VDBE).
//!
//! The VDBE is a register-based virtual machine that execute bytecode
//! instructions that represent SQL statements. When an application prepares
//! an SQL statement, the statement is compiled into a sequence of bytecode
//! instructions that perform the needed operations, such as reading or
//! writing to a b-tree, sorting, or aggregating data.
//!
//! The instruction set of the VDBE is similar to SQLite's instruction set,
//! but with the exception that bytecodes that perform I/O operations are
//! return execution back to the caller instead of blocking. This is because
//! Limbo is designed for applications that need high concurrency such as
//! serverless runtimes. In addition, asynchronous I/O makes storage
//! disaggregation easier.
//!
//! You can find a full list of SQLite opcodes at:

If P2 is 2 or more then an exclusive transaction is started. P1 is the index of the database file on which the transaction is started. Index 0 is the main database file and index 1 is the file used for temporary tables. Indices of 2 or more are used for attached databases. If a write-transaction is started and the Vdbe.usesStmtJournal flag is true (this flag is set if the Vdbe may modify more than one row and may throw an ABORT exception), a statement transaction may also be opened. More specifically, a statement transaction is opened iff the database connection is currently not in autocommit mode, or if there are other active statements. A statement transaction allows the changes made by this VDBE to be rolled back after an error without having to roll back the entire transaction. If no error is encountered, the statement transaction will automatically commit when the VDBE halts. If P5!=0 then this opcode also checks the schema cookie against P3 and the schema generation counter against P4. The cookie changes its value whenever the database schema changes. This operation is used to detect when that the cookie has changed and that the current process needs to reread the schema. If the schema cookie in P3 differs from the schema cookie in the database header or if the schema generation counter in P4 differs from the current generation counter, then an SQLITE_SCHEMA error is raised and execution halts. The sqlite3_step() wrapper function might then reprepare the statement and rerun it from the beginning."]
